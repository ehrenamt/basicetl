# simpleETL

> [WORK IN PROGRESS] A basic tool for ETL processes, mostly for local work.

# Description

SimpleETL simplifies ETL processes by abstracting error checking and extracting logic. Simply provide the sources, whether local files or via a remote resource, and specify the transformation and output.

Useful for bootstrapping local data analysis and ML projects.

Currently does not work with zipped files.
